# Bits-and-Droids-flight-connector
Repositry for the mfs2020 flight connector by Bits and Droids

This project runs on the QT UI framework https://www.qt.io/download-open-source

# Tools needed to compile
Qt version 6.2
Qt additions:
  - Qt Charts
  - Qt Serialport
  - Qt Graphics

Add the DLLs to your build directory to compile the code
Can also be run from third party IDE's like CLion. This requires a custom setup process you need to find yourself.

# Arduino / ESP32 library
The libraries are a way to simplify the communication between your microcontroller and the connector. They have their own repository which can be found at:
https://github.com/BitsAndDroids/BitsAndDroidsFlightSimLibrary

# Documentation
The documentation for the connector can be found on the Bits and Droids website.
